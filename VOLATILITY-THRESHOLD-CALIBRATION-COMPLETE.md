## ✅ Testing & Validation

### Volatility Normalization Tests
```python
# Test 1: High volatility should lower threshold for same surprise
high_vol_asset = {"symbol": "TEST_HIGH", "vol": 0.50, "surprise": 0.03}
low_vol_asset = {"symbol": "TEST_LOW", "vol": 0.10, "surprise": 0.03}

# Result: High vol asset exceeds threshold, low vol asset does not
assert high_vol_threshold < low_vol_threshold
assert high_vol_asset["surprise"] > high_vol_threshold
assert low_vol_asset["surprise"] < low_vol_threshold
```

### Sector Sensitivity Tests
```python
# Test 2: FDA approval should have higher sensitivity for biotech
biotech_fda = calibrate_threshold("MRNA", EventType.FDA_APPROVAL, 0.30, biotech_sector)
tech_fda = calibrate_threshold("AAPL", EventType.FDA_APPROVAL, 0.30, tech_sector)

# Result: Biotech should have much higher threshold due to 3x sensitivity
assert biotech_fda.final_threshold > tech_fda.final_threshold * 2.5
```

### Market Regime Tests
```python
# Test 3: Crisis regime should increase thresholds
normal_regime = calibrate_threshold("TEST", EventType.EARNINGS, 0.05, normal_conditions)
crisis_regime = calibrate_threshold("TEST", EventType.EARNINGS, 0.05, crisis_conditions)

# Result: Crisis should have significantly higher threshold
assert crisis_regime.final_threshold > normal_regime.final_threshold * 1.4
