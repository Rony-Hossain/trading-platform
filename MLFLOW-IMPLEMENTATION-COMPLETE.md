# MLflow Tracking Server Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

The MLflow tracking server has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Analysis Service, replacing temporary CSV/JSON logging with production-grade experiment management and model registry capabilities.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core MLflow Integration (`mlflow_tracking.py`)
- **MLflowTracker Class**: Comprehensive MLflow integration with async methods
- **Experiment Management**: Create, track, and manage ML experiments
- **Model Registry**: Version and lifecycle management for ML models
- **Artifact Storage**: Store model artifacts, feature importance, and evaluation results
- **Run Search**: Advanced filtering and querying of experiment runs

### 2. Data Structures
- **ExperimentConfig**: Configuration for experiment setup and metadata
- **ModelMetrics**: Comprehensive metrics including financial performance indicators
- **ExperimentResult**: Structured results from experiment logging

### 3. API Endpoints (`main.py`)
Complete set of RESTful API endpoints for MLflow operations:

#### Experiment Management
- `GET /mlflow/experiments` - List all experiments
- `GET /mlflow/experiments/{experiment_name}/runs` - List runs for experiment
- `GET /mlflow/runs/{run_id}` - Get detailed run information

#### Model Registry
- `GET /mlflow/models` - List registered models
- `GET /mlflow/models/{model_name}` - Get model details and versions
- `POST /mlflow/models/promote` - Promote models between stages

#### Search and Analytics
- `POST /mlflow/search` - Advanced run search with filtering
- `GET /mlflow/leaderboard/{symbol}` - Model performance rankings
- `GET /mlflow/status` - Service status and configuration

### 4. Integration with Existing Services

#### Forecasting Service Integration
- **Model Evaluation**: MLflow logging integrated into `evaluate_advanced_models()`
- **Feature Selection**: Experiment tracking for feature optimization
- **Random Forest Retraining**: Replaced JSON file logging with MLflow
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation if MLflow is unavailable

#### Key Integration Points
```python
# Advanced model evaluation with MLflow
evaluation_result = await evaluator.evaluate_models(...)
await self.mlflow_tracker.log_complete_experiment(
    experiment_config=model_run_config,
    model=evaluation_result.trained_models.get(model_name),
    parameters={...},
    metrics=mlflow_metrics,
    artifacts={...}
)

# Feature selection with experiment tracking
await self.mlflow_tracker.log_complete_experiment(
    experiment_config=feature_experiment_config,
    parameters={...},
    metrics=feature_metrics,
    artifacts={
        "feature_rankings": {...},
        "selected_features": [...],
        "performance_metrics": {...}
    }
)
```

## Configuration and Deployment

### Environment Setup
```bash
# MLflow installation (completed)
pip install mlflow

# Tracking URI configuration
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=./mlruns  # Default file-based storage
```

### Service Configuration
```python
# MLflow integration in ForecastingService
self.mlflow_tracker = MLflowTracker(tracking_uri="./mlruns")
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Model Evaluation with MLflow
```bash
# Evaluate models with automatic MLflow logging
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8003/models/evaluate/AAPL?cv_folds=5"
```

### 2. Feature Selection Tracking
```bash
# Optimize features with experiment tracking
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/features/optimize/AAPL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_reduction": 0.5, "method": "composite"}'
```

### 3. Model Leaderboard
```bash
# Get best performing models for a symbol
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8003/mlflow/leaderboard/AAPL?metric=sharpe_ratio&limit=10"
```

### 4. Experiment Search
```bash
# Search experiments with custom filters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/mlflow/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filter_string": "metrics.r2 > 0.5 and params.symbol = '\''AAPL'\''", "order_by": ["metrics.sharpe_ratio DESC"]}'
```

## Migration from CSV/JSON Logging
