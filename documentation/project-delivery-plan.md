# Project Delivery Plan - High-End Trading Platform Upgrade

This playbook translates the upgrade roadmap into an execution-ready program. Follow the twelve steps to keep product, engineering, quant, and operations teams aligned from scoping to release.

---

## 1. Scope & Guardrails (1-2 pages)

**Problem statement**
The platform delivers strong data collection and baseline forecasting, but it lacks multi-factor fusion, event-aware intelligence, and institutional-grade execution controls. Traders and quants struggle to turn data into alpha because surprise modeling, options context, and governance are missing.

**SMART goals**
- Reduce the time from event release to actionable signal from roughly 10 minutes to under 60 seconds by 2026-02-01.
- Lift directional hit rate by 8 percentage points (42% to 50%) on a 90-day rolling window by 2026-03-15.
- Keep live versus backtest P&L drift within +/-10% by 2026-04-30.
- Achieve 99.9% API uptime with sub-500 ms p95 latency on forecast endpoints by 2026-02-15.

**Non-goals**
- No crypto or FX execution (data only) in this cycle.
- No leveraged or derivative execution; focus is equities plus options analytics.
- No full portfolio management module beyond scoped risk guardrails.

**Success metrics**
- Strategy adoption: percentage of portfolios using event-driven factors (target 70%).
- Latency: event signal publish latency below 60 seconds at p95.
- Conversion: count of paper strategies promoted to live each quarter.
- Voice of customer: internal trader NPS improves by 20 points.
- Support load: data-quality tickets cut by 50%.

**Constraints**
- Budget: 6 FTEs (2 backend, 1 ML, 1 frontend, 1 DevOps, 1 PM/quant) for nine months.
- Deadline: Phase 1 deliverables must land by 2025-12-31 for regulatory review.
- Compliance: SEC/FINRA rules, vendor terms of service.
- Tech stack: FastAPI, TimescaleDB/Postgres, Redis, Next.js, Python, TypeScript.
- Capacity: two-week sprints, average velocity 30 story points.

## 2. Product Narrative & Personas

**Narrative**
"Alex, a quant trader, logs in at 08:00 on earnings day. The Event Dashboard flags EA's FIFA launch with a 6% implied move. Minutes after the press release the platform scores an +11% actual move, well beyond expectations. Sentiment spikes confirm the surprise, an event play is triggered with tight stops, and by the close Alex reviews fills, latency, and SHAP attribution in the execution journal."

**Personas**
- **Alex Nguyen - Quant Trader**: seeks fast, explainable event trades; pain points are slow signals, unclear model rationale, and execution slippage; expert Python API user.
- **Priya Desai - Quant Researcher**: needs reliable, point-in-time datasets and reproducible experiments; pain points are inconsistent timestamps and lack of experiment tracking; heavy notebook user.
- **Evan Morales - Risk Lead**: owns guardrails and audit trails; pain points are missing trade logs and visibility; consumes dashboards and downloadable reports.

## 3. Epics, Features, and Stories

**Epics (4-12 weeks each)**
1. Multi-Factor Data Fusion (Phase 1).
2. Event Intelligence and Surprise Scoring (Phase 1-2).
3. Advanced Modeling and MLOps (Phase 2).
4. Risk and Execution Baseline (Phase 1).
5. Institutional Insights and Explainability (Phase 3).
6. Platform Hardening and Streaming (Phase 4).

**Example decomposition**
- Epic: Event Intelligence and Surprise Scoring
  - Feature: Event data ingestion service (2 weeks).
    - Story: As a quant trader I can view upcoming events with implied move bands so that I can stage trades ahead of catalysts.
  - Feature: Implied move and surprise delta API (1 week).
    - Story: As the analysis service I can combine implied move with actual price to compute shock scores within 60 seconds.
- Epic: Advanced Modeling and MLOps
  - Feature: LSTM ensemble pipeline (2 weeks).
  - Feature: MLflow experiment tracking (1 week).

**Story template (INVEST)**

## 4. Issue Types and Taxonomy

- Epic: outcome-level initiative.
- Story: user-visible slice of value.
- Task: technical work that supports stories.
- Bug: defect in released behaviour.
- Spike: time-boxed research.
- Change Request: scope change after commitment.
- Risk: tracked uncertainty or blocker.
- Chore/Infrastructure: upkeep and tooling.

Link issues via "relates to", "blocks", "is blocked by", "duplicates", "caused by". Apply labels for domain (sentiment, options), platform (web, api, infra), component (analysis-service, strategy-service), and priority (P0-P3).

---

## 5. Workflows and Definitions of Ready/Done

**Story workflow**
Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> In QA -> Ready for Release -> Released -> Done.

- Ready requires Definition of Ready: clear acceptance criteria, designs or data notes, dependencies resolved, test ideas captured.
- Done requires Definition of Done: code merged, automated tests passing, docs and runbooks updated, feature flags wired, telemetry added, deployed to target environment, rollback plan validated.

**Bug workflow**
New -> Triage (severity, priority) -> In Progress -> Fix in Review -> Verify -> Released -> Closed.

---

## 6. Estimation and Planning

- Estimation style: Fibonacci story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13); raise a spike when uncertainty is high.
- Capacity planning: sprint velocity (30 points) minus meetings, PTO, and on-call load; plan 70-80% of capacity.
- Prioritisation: use RICE for roadmap sizing and WSJF when balancing cross-team work.
- Sprint cadence: two-week iterations with backlog refinement (weekly) and demo/retro at sprint end.

---

## 7. Roadmap and Release Plan

- Maintain a Now / Next / Later board.
  - Now (Q4 2025): Phase 1 deliverables.
  - Next (Q1 2026): Phase 2 modelling and MLOps.
  - Later (Q2-Q3 2026): Phases 3 and 4.
- Release cadence: weekly production release train with a hotfix lane for P0 and P1 issues.
- Tie each epic to outcomes and target dates (for example "Event Surprise MVP" by 2025-12-31 with a one-week risk buffer).

---

## 8. Architecture Notes and Change Control

- Record Architecture Decision Records (docs/adrs/ADR-xxxx.md) capturing context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.
- Maintain a dependency map of services, third-party APIs (Finnhub, NewsAPI, options vendor), data contracts, and SLAs.
- Any breaking schema or API change requires an ADR plus versioning plan, migration script, and rollback checklist.

---

## 9. Branching, Environments, CI/CD, and Quality Gates

- Branching: trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches (<3 days) and small pull requests.
- Environments: Dev (local/docker), Staging (auto deploy), Prod (release train). Consider ephemeral preview environments for frontend/API when helpful.
- CI gates: linting, type checks, unit tests, security/secret scans, build artefacts.
- CD gates: end-to-end smoke tests, contract tests, performance baselines, canary deployment with auto rollback.
- Observability: structured logs, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, dashboards per epic.

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

- Follow the test pyramid: many unit tests, moderate integration tests, few but critical end-to-end tests.
- Backend focus: idempotency, data migration, contract tests, replay simulations for event-driven flows.
- Frontend focus: accessibility checks, Playwright/Cypress coverage on search, alerts, portfolio workflows.
- Performance: benchmark analysis and event APIs under burst load; include latency budgets.
- Security: run OWASP ZAP or equivalent, plus dependency scanning.

---

## 11. Governance, Risks, and Rituals

- Rituals: backlog refinement (weekly), sprint planning (biweekly), daily stand-up (15 minutes), sprint review/demo, retrospective, and bug triage twice per week.
- RACI example: Product (Accountable) for scope, Engineering (Responsible) for delivery, Quant Research (Consulted), Compliance (Informed).
- Risk register: track risk, likelihood, impact, owner, mitigation, trigger, status.
- Security and privacy: threat-model each epic, classify data, align with vendor DPAs, enforce access reviews.
