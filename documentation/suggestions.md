# Trading Platform  €" Detailed Suggestions

This document consolidates actionable recommendations to strengthen the project across frontend, backend, databases, algorithms, and DevOps. It reflects the current repo (Nx + Next.js frontend, docker-compose with Postgres/Redis) and adds a clear roadmap.

---

## Quick Wins (Do First)

- Frontend cleanup in `AlertsNotifications.tsx`:
  - Remove unused imports and the unused `showNotifications` state.
  - Parse `newAlert.targetValue` as number before passing to `getConditionText` and `Alert.targetValue`.
  - Initialize mock alerts only on mount, not on `watchlist` changes.
  - Fix interval stale state with `useRef` or recreate interval when `alerts` changes.
- Add `.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_API`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYSIS_API`.
- Expand `docker-compose.yml` healthchecks; add compose targets for APIs when they exist.
- Create OpenAPI specs (scaffolded under `documentation/contracts/`) and plan client codegen in the frontend.

---

## Frontend (Nx + Next.js 15)

- Code quality & state
  - Split large components (e.g., Alerts UI, Create Form) into smaller pieces; use `React.memo` where prop-stable.
  - Persist watchlist and alerts (localStorage now; API later) to avoid losing state on reload.
  - Prefer typed form models (explicit `NewAlertForm`) and input type `number` with validation.

- Data fetching & caching
  - Use React Query (@tanstack/react-query): caching, retries, `staleTime` per endpoint; de-dup requests.
  - Axios interceptors for auth and consistent error normalization.
  - Real-time: WebSocket/SSE for quotes; keep polling fallback with exponential backoff on failures.

- Notifications & UX
  - Replace custom popup with Radix Toast for accessibility; keep "Enable Notifications" button for permission gating.
  - Batch UI state updates when multiple alerts trigger to minimize re-renders.

- Performance & accessibility
  - Dynamic import for heavy chart/analysis components.
  - A11y: label inputs, keyboard navigation in menus/dialogs, focus management.

- Testing
  - Unit: `getConditionText`, alert toggling, notification dismissal.
  - Integration: MSW/axios-mock-adapter for API states (success/error/empty).
  - E2E: Playwright/Cypress for main flows (search, add to watchlist, set alert, see notification).

## Backend (APIs & Services)

Frontend expects two services (matching `lib/api.ts`):

- Market Data API (suggest FastAPI or NestJS)
  - GET `/stocks/{symbol}`  †' real-time price snapshot.
  - GET `/stocks/{symbol}/historyperiod=1y`  †' `{ data: HistoricalData[] }`.
  - GET `/stocks/searchq=query`  †' array of matches.
  - GET `/stocks/{symbol}/profile`  †' company metadata.
  - Optional: WS/SSE (`/realtime`) to push updates.

- Analysis API
  - GET `/analyze/{symbol}period=6mo`  †' `{ technical_analysis }`.
  - GET `/analyze/{symbol}/patterns`  †' `{ patterns }`.
  - GET `/analyze/{symbol}/advancedindicators=a,b`  †' `{ advanced_indicators }`.
  - GET `/forecast/{symbol}model_type=ensemble&horizon=5`  †' `ForecastData`.
  - GET `/analyze/{symbol}/comprehensive`  †' combined report.
  - POST `/analyze/batch`  †' batch results.

- Reliability
  - Rate-limit, timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers for upstream vendor calls.
  - Normalize timestamps (ISO 8601, UTC); consistent symbol normalization.
  - Cache hot quotes/indicators in Redis; set sensible TTLs; avoid cache stampede.

- Security & auth
  - JWT (access/refresh) or OAuth; scopes/roles for alerts/portfolio endpoints.
  - Strict input validation (Pydantic/Zod/DTOs) and CORS for FE domain.

- Observability
  - Structured logs, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces.
  - Health/readiness endpoints with DB/Redis checks.

- Testing
  - Unit tests for indicator math and alert rules.
  - Integration tests with Postgres/Redis (Testcontainers).
  - Contract tests against OpenAPI.

## Database Choice & Rationale

- Primary: PostgreSQL (ACID, joins, JSONB) for users, portfolios, alerts, audit logs.
- Cache & real-time: Redis for hot quotes/indicators and pub/sub.
- Time-series: TimescaleDB (extension) or native partitioning for candles; later consider ClickHouse for massive analytics.
- Avoid Hadoop here; use S3/Parquet for cheap archives and offline ML if needed.

- Suggested mapping
  - OLTP: PostgreSQL (users, portfolios, alerts, triggers).
  - Candles: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB or partitions.
  - Cache/pub-sub: Redis.
  - Forecast/analysis caches: Redis (hot), Postgres JSONB (persistent).

- Schema outline
  - users, portfolios, portfolio_positions, watchlists, watchlist_items.
  - alerts (type enum; target_value; cooldown; metadata), alert_triggers.
  - candles (symbol, ts, ohlcv), technical_analysis_cache, forecast_cache.

- Indexing & ops
  - alerts: `(user_id, is_active)`, `(symbol)`; triggers: `(alert_id, triggered_at desc)`.
  - candles: PK `(symbol, ts)`; BRIN on `ts` or Timescale hypertables.
  - Migrations: Alembic/Prisma/Flyway; run on startup via flag in non €'prod.
  - Retention: monthly partitions, prune/archive older data; VACUUM/ANALYZE tuning.
  - Security: least-privilege roles, consider RLS for multi €'tenant.
  - Pooling: PgBouncer for high concurrency.

- Example DDL (starter)

```sql
create type alert_type as enum ('price_above','price_below','price_change','volume_spike','technical_signal');

create table users (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  email text unique not null,
  password_hash text not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create table alerts (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid not null references users(id) on delete cascade,
  symbol text not null,
  type alert_type not null,
  target_value numeric not null,
  is_active boolean not null default true,
  is_triggered boolean not null default false,
  cooldown_sec int not null default 0,
  metadata jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  triggered_at timestamptz
);

create index idx_alerts_user_active on alerts(user_id, is_active);
create index idx_alerts_symbol on alerts(symbol);

create table alert_triggers (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  alert_id uuid not null references alerts(id) on delete cascade,
  triggered_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  observed_value numeric not null,
  message text
);

create table candles (
  symbol text not null,
  ts timestamptz not null,
  open numeric not null,
  high numeric not null,
  low numeric not null,
  close numeric not null,
  volume bigint not null,
  primary key (symbol, ts)
);
```

## Backend Architecture & Interfaces

- Public API  †' Frontend
  - REST + JSON with OpenAPI contracts (scaffolded here):
    - `documentation/contracts/market-data.yaml`
    - `documentation/contracts/analysis.yaml`
  - Generate typed clients in the frontend (e.g., `openapi-typescript`, `orval`).

- Internal services (mid €'term)
  - gRPC with Protobuf for low €'latency typed RPC among Market Data, Analysis, and Alert Engine.
  - Manage `.proto` with `buf`; avoid exposing gRPC to browsers (unless using gRPC €'web).

- Events/streaming
  - Protobuf or JSON Schema for quotes/alerts on Kafka/Redis Streams when streaming is introduced.

- Operational standards
  - Idempotency keys on writes, rate limiting, strict validation, structured errors.
  - `/health` and `/metrics` with dependency checks.

- Next steps
  - Complete the OpenAPI specs; wire codegen; extract an Alert Engine worker for async evaluation.

## Forecasting & Trading Algorithms

- Principles
  - Optimize risk €'adjusted returns (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar), not only accuracy.
  - Full pipeline: signal  †' position sizing  †' risk controls  †' execution.

- Data & labels
  - Multi €'horizon forward returns (1d/5d/21d) using log €'returns; or classification with thresholds.
  - Combine daily OHLCV with minute bars (if available) with strict end €'of €'bar alignment.
  - Enrich with fundamentals, macro, sector/ETF proxies, earnings, corporate actions.

- Feature engineering
  - Price/volume, momentum/trend (SMA/EMA/MACD/RSI), mean €'reversion (bands), regime flags, cross €'sectional ranks, calendar effects.

- Models (progressive)
  - Baselines: ridge/lasso/logistic, tree €'based (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost).
  - Sequences: TCN/LSTM/GRU, TFT, N €'BEATS.
  - Probabilistic: quantile regression, NGBoost; output intervals.
  - Ensembling: average/stack; weight by recent regime €'specific performance.

- Regime detection & switching
  - HMM/Markov or volatility/trend rules; blend specialists by regime with smoothing.

- Validation & leakage control
  - Walk €'forward or Purged K €'Fold with embargo; lag slow data to public availability.
  - Symbol €'holdout splits to test generalization.

- Backtesting realism
  - Costs/slippage, liquidity caps (%ADV), participation limits; next €'bar execution; corporate actions adjustments.

- Position sizing & risk
  - Volatility targeting, conservative Kelly/mean €'variance optimizer with constraints; drawdown/daily €'loss limits; diversification caps.

- Uncertainty & calibration
  - Predictive intervals, reliability diagrams; abstain or down €'size when uncertainty is high.

- Online learning & drift
  - Monitor live vs. backtest; drift tests; rolling retrains; champion €"challenger with canary capital.

- Metrics
  - Trading: CAGR, Sharpe/Sortino, max DD, turnover, capacity, exposure.
  - Forecast: directional accuracy, correlation, MAE/MAPE, pinball loss, calibration error.

- Implementation outline
  1) Boosted trees on engineered features; target 5d return.
  2) Walk €'forward evaluation; multiple symbols.
  3) Execution €'aware backtest (costs/liquidity); volatility targeting.
  4) Add quantile model; size = f(expected_return, uncertainty, vol).
  5) Add regime switcher; ensemble trend vs. mean €'reversion.
  6) Paper €'trade, compare live vs. backtest; tighten guardrails.

- Data pipeline & ops
  - Version datasets (DVC/LakeFS); store artifacts; log predictions/positions/PnL attribution; alerts for degradation.

- Compliance & ethics
  - Clear disclaimers; respect vendor ToS; guardrails to prevent excessive leverage/concentration.

---

## Docker & DevOps

- Compose topology
  - Keep Postgres and Redis; add `market-data-api`, `analysis-api`, and `trading-frontend` services with healthchecks.

- Dockerfiles
  - Frontend: multi €'stage build; Node 20 €'alpine; non €'root; consider Next.js standalone output.
  - Python APIs: `python:3.11-slim`, `gunicorn` + `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`; non €'root.

- Env & secrets
  - Add `.env.example`; never commit secrets; use Docker secrets or CI secrets in prod.
  - Local dev overrides in `docker-compose.override.yml` (volumes, hot reload).

- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions: lint/test/build; cache Nx and package managers; build/push images; `nx affected` for FE.

- Observability & security
  - Central logs (Loki/ELK), metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OTel). Trivy scans, non €'root containers, minimal images.

---

## Shared Contracts & Types

- Keep OpenAPI specs in `documentation/contracts/`; generate FE clients (`openapi-typescript`/`orval`).
- For monorepo sharing, consider a shared types package or tRPC (only if FE/BE are tightly coupled and you accept its trade €'offs).

---

## Data Governance & Compliance

- Respect vendor ToS & rate limits; budget requests and backoff.
- PII: encrypt sensitive fields; strict access controls; audit logs.

---

## High-End Expansion Initiatives

- Feature store & point-in-time governance (Feast or temporal Postgres tables) to eliminate leakage and enable reuse.
- Automated data quality gates (Great Expectations/Monte Carlo) with anomaly alerting for macro/options/event feeds.
- Continuous retraining cadence with drift monitoring (PSI/KS) and champion-challenger promotion.
- Real-time feature streaming via Kafka/Redis Streams plus low-latency inference (TorchServe/ONNX Runtime).
- Smart order routing, dark-pool access, and detailed trade journaling for execution analytics.
- Security/compliance hardening: Vault/Secrets Manager, Terraform IaC, container scanning, signed non-root images.
- CI/CD maturity: comprehensive unit/integration/synthetic tests, GitHub Actions pipelines, automated deployments.
- Collaboration layer: JupyterHub/Deepnote tied to feature store; Slack/Teams alert workflows with deep links.
- Stress testing & scenario simulations to replay crises/synthetic shocks for robustness checks.
- Alternative data onboarding framework (satellite, card spend, web scraping) with ROI tracking.

These initiatives align with documentation/high-end-upgrade-plan.md and the updated TODO list for execution.
