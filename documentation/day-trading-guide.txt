DAY TRADING AND OPTIONS TRADING PLAYBOOK

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Risk per trade: 0.25–0.5% of account equity
- Daily loss cap: 1–2% of equity; stop trading when reached
- Max consecutive losses: stop after 3 losses; review before resuming
- Trade liquid symbols only: tight spreads, deep books, high volume
- Master one setup before adding more; process and journaling over P&L

MARKET STRUCTURE BASICS
- Time of day: open (9:30–10:30 ET) most volatile; midday chop; power hour (15:00–16:00) trend resolution
- Auctions and gaps: opening/closing auctions can gap; plan for continuation or gap-fill
- Liquidity: spreads and queue position impact slippage; avoid illiquid names

CORE INTRADAY SETUPS
- Opening Range Breakout (ORB): define first 5–15m range; enter on break; stop outside range; targets via measured move or VWAP
- VWAP Plays: trend continuation above/below VWAP; mean-reversion to VWAP after exhaustion; avoid counter-trend during strong momentum
- EMA Pullbacks: trend with 9/20 EMA; buy pullbacks to rising 9/20 with confirmation; stop past swing; partials at HOD/LOD or prior level
- Gap-and-Go / Gap-Fill: catalyst gaps; either continuation with volume or fade to fill; use premarket levels
- Volume Spike Reversal: parabolic move into HTF level; lower high + volume divergence; tight stop

INDICATORS AND LEVELS
- Baseline: VWAP, 9/20 EMA, ATR(14), RSI(14), volume bars; optional MACD histogram
- Key levels: premark previous day high/low, overnight high/low, weekly/daily S/R, pivot points
- Volatility: use ATR for stops and position sizing; adjust size when ATR expands/contracts

ORDER EXECUTION
- Order types: limit for entries; stop-limit for breakouts (reasonable limit offset); OCO brackets (stop + target)
- Scaling: scale in only with high-quality signals; scale out into liquidity; avoid averaging down losers
- Hotkeys: buy/sell, halve position, flatten; reduces latency and mental load

RISK AND SIZING
- Volatility-based sizing: shares = risk_dollars / stop_distance (use ATR multiple)
- Hard stops: always place protective stops; honor them; no “hoping”
- Portfolio limits: max 2–3 concurrent positions; avoid correlated positions; define max leverage and exposure

OPTIONS TRADING BASICS
- Greeks: delta (directional exposure), gamma (delta change, high near expiry), theta (time decay), vega (IV sensitivity)
- Implied volatility: use IV rank; beware IV crush after events (earnings); prefer liquid chains (tight spreads)
- Day-trading options structures:
  - Debit verticals (bull call/bear put): defined risk, directional, less theta decay than naked long
  - Credit spreads (bear call/bull put): fade at levels, positive theta; strict risk discipline required
  - Broken-wing butterfly: defined risk around a target/pin; favorable RR if price hovers near body
  - Straddle/strangle: for expected large move; need catalyst and IV expansion; manage IV crush risk carefully
- 0DTE caution: extreme gamma/theta; keep size tiny; consider index options (e.g., SPX) for cash settlement

REGULATORY AND OPERATIONS
- PDT rule (US): < $25k equity on margin accounts → max 3 day trades per rolling 5 business days
- Taxes: short-term gains taxed as ordinary income; track wash sales; assignment risk on American options
- Margin and assignment: understand buying power reduction, early assignment handling for short options

DAILY ROUTINE
- Premarket (60–90m): scan news/catalysts, gappers, expected ranges; mark HTF levels; define A/B plans; set day’s risk
- Opening hour: execute only planned setups; use bracket orders; avoid chasing; respect first halt/volatility pauses
- Midday: reduce size and frequency; A+ setups only
- Power hour: re-engage if trend/levels break; avoid late impulse trades without plan
- Post-market: journal trades (setup, entry/stop/target, R multiples, mistakes); screenshot charts; weekly review

PLAYBOOK TEMPLATE (PER SETUP)
- Context: market regime, breadth, IV level, catalysts today
- Trigger: objective conditions (e.g., ORB high break with volume and VWAP support)
- Invalidation: specific level/time conditions
- Entry/Stop/Targets: numeric plan; bracket details and partials logic
- Risk: $ risk, expected RR, max slippage; position size formula
- Checklist: confirm volume, spread, route, news risk, correlation
- Post-trade notes: reasons to hold/exit; mistakes and improvements

PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (THIS REPO)
- Intraday data
  - Add 1-minute historical endpoint and storage (yfinance interval='1m' or vendor); store last N days; partitions/hypertables
  - UI: 1D minute chart with rolling last 60–120 minutes; sticky axes; toggle live mode
- Real-time engine
  - WebSocket push cadence 1s for selected symbols; ping/heartbeat; backoff/reconnect
  - Alerts worker: Redis-backed rules: VWAP cross, ORB breaks, RSI extremes, % change, volume spikes; cooldown/idempotency
- Options support
  - Options chain endpoint: strikes, expiries, greeks, IV; caching; refresh cadence
  - Strategy builder: debit/credit verticals first; compute breakevens, RR, theoreticals; P&L graph
  - UI: chain table (filters by delta/IV rank), strategy builder, risk graph
- Risk controls
  - Server limits: daily loss cap, per-trade risk, max open positions; auto-flat on breach
  - Journal service: auto-logging of orders/fills/PNL; tagging and metrics (expectancy, win rate, avg hold)
- Execution
  - Paper trading ticket: market/limit, bracket (TP/SL), partials; later integrate broker (Alpaca/IBKR)
  - Hotkeys; latency indicators; health checks for data and broker connections

CHECKLISTS
- Pre-trade: market context aligned; setup conditions met; risk/size computed; order type selected; stop/target defined; news risk checked
- During trade: move stop to reduce risk only after strong confirmation; scale out at planned levels; avoid adding to losers
- Post-trade: log objectively; classify setup quality; tag mistakes (late entry, over-size, no stop, etc.)

RISK DISCLOSURE REMINDER
- Trading involves substantial risk; do not trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
