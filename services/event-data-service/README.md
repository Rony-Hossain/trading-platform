# Event Data Service Providers

This service ingests scheduled events and real-time headlines from external providers. To avoid API throttling and authentication issues, set the following environment variables (see .env.example).

## Scheduled Calendar Providers


### Provider Failover
- EVENT_CALENDAR_PROVIDERS_JSON: optional JSON array of provider definitions with 
ame, url, pi_key, headers, etc. Providers are attempted in order.
- EVENT_CALENDAR_PROVIDER_MAX_FAILURES: consecutive failures before backing off a provider (default 3).
- EVENT_CALENDAR_PROVIDER_FAILBACK_SECONDS: backoff duration in seconds after max failures (default 600).


### Data Quality Settings
- EVENT_CALENDAR_DEDUPE_WINDOW_MINUTES: time window for in-memory duplicate suppression (default 60).
- EVENT_CALENDAR_MAX_HORIZON_DAYS: discard events scheduled beyond this horizon (default 365).
- EVENT_CALENDAR_MIN_SYMBOL_LENGTH: minimum ticker length accepted (default 1).
- EVENT_CALENDAR_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES: optional comma-separated whitelist of categories (default accepts all).

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| EVENT_CALENDAR_URL | Base URL returning a JSON payload with upcoming events. | Endpoint must accept GET with optional query params defined by your provider. |
| EVENT_CALENDAR_API_KEY | API key/token for the calendar provider. | Injected as X-API-KEY header. Update code if provider requires a different field. |
| EVENT_CALENDAR_PROVIDER | Friendly name identifying the provider. | Stored in events.source to scope deduplication. |
| EVENT_CALENDAR_POLL_INTERVAL | Seconds between poll cycles (default 900). | Respect provider rate limits. | 

### Expected Payload Shape

The collector expects either:

`json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "symbol": "AAPL",
      "title": "Apple Q4 Earnings Call",
      "category": "earnings",
      "scheduled_at": "2025-10-28T21:00:00Z",
      "timezone": "America/New_York",
      "description": "Conference call details...",
      "id": "external-id-123"
    }
  ]
}
`

or a top-level array. Any additional fields are stored under metadata.

## Headline Providers

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| EVENT_HEADLINE_URL | Endpoint returning breaking headlines in JSON. | Must provide symbol, headline, and published_at. |
| EVENT_HEADLINE_API_KEY | API key/token for the headline feed. | Injected as X-API-KEY header by default. |
| EVENT_HEADLINE_PROVIDER | Friendly name for logging/metadata. | Persists in event_headlines.source. |
| EVENT_HEADLINE_POLL_INTERVAL | Poll interval in seconds (default 120). | Tune per provider policy. |
| EVENT_HEADLINE_MATCH_WINDOW_MINUTES | Minutes around event time to link headlines to scheduled events. | Default 120. |

### Headline Payload Example

`json
{
  "headlines": [
    {
      "symbol": "AAPL",
      "headline": "Apple beats on revenue, stock jumps",
      "published_at": "2025-10-28T21:05:00Z",
      "summary": "Breaking news summary",
      "url": "https://news.example.com/aapl",
      "id": "headline-789"
    }
  ]
}
`

## Rate Limit Guidance

- **Schedule feeds**: polling every 15 minutes (900 seconds) is typically safe for quarterly earnings calendars. Adjust according to provider SLAs.
- **Headline feeds**: high-frequency sources should be polled between 30ï¿½120 seconds. Check contractual rate limits and adjust EVENT_HEADLINE_POLL_INTERVAL accordingly.
- **Backoff**: When rates are tight, consider modifying the ingestors to honour provider-specific retry headers (e.g., Retry-After).

## Required Environment Variables

Ensure these keys are set (defaults are provided for development):

- EVENT_DB_URL
- EVENT_CALENDAR_URL, EVENT_CALENDAR_API_KEY, EVENT_CALENDAR_PROVIDER, EVENT_CALENDAR_POLL_INTERVAL
- EVENT_HEADLINE_URL, EVENT_HEADLINE_API_KEY, EVENT_HEADLINE_PROVIDER, EVENT_HEADLINE_POLL_INTERVAL, EVENT_HEADLINE_MATCH_WINDOW_MINUTES

Refer to .env.example for sample values. Update secrets before deploying to production.
## Impact Scoring

The ingestor now derives a market-moving potential score for every event when the provider does not supply one. The heuristic combines:
- Category priors (earnings, regulatory, product launch, etc.) with optional overrides via `EVENT_IMPACT_CATEGORY_BASE` (JSON map of category -> score).
- Company context such as market cap tiers and average daily volume when available in the payload.
- Expected move signals (`implied_move`, `expected_move_pct`, `historical_avg_move`) sourced from metadata or top-level keys.
- Qualitative flags (`is_major`, `importance`, `confidence`, `is_preliminary`).

The final score is clamped to a 1-10 scale. A breakdown is stored in `event.metadata.impact_analysis` so downstream services can audit the contributing factors.
## Feed Health Monitoring

Each provider poll is tracked for success or failure. The `/health` endpoint now includes a `feeds` dictionary, and `/health/feeds` exposes the detailed snapshot. Configuration:

- `EVENT_FEED_ALERT_THRESHOLD` (default `3`): consecutive failures before a feed is marked `down` and an alert is emitted.
- `EVENT_FEED_ALERT_WEBHOOK`: optional HTTP endpoint that receives JSON payloads when a feed degrades or recovers.
- `EVENT_FEED_ALERT_HEADERS`: optional JSON map of headers for the webhook requests (use for auth tokens).

When a provider remains in backoff it is marked `paused`; successful polls clear the failure counter and emit a recovery notification if a feed previously alerted.
## Webhook Notifications

Configure outbound webhooks to forward newly ingested events, manual event mutations, and incoming headlines to downstream services.

- `EVENT_WEBHOOK_TARGETS`: JSON array of targets `[{"url": "https://example.com/webhook", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}, "timeout": 3.0}]`.
- `EVENT_WEBHOOK_URL`: shorthand for a single endpoint (ignored when `EVENT_WEBHOOK_TARGETS` is supplied).
- `EVENT_WEBHOOK_HEADERS`: optional JSON object merged into the POST headers for the single-endpoint configuration.
- `EVENT_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`: request timeout in seconds (default 5).

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "type": "event.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T21:00:00Z",
  "data": { "id": "...", "symbol": "AAPL", ... }
}
```

Supported event types include `event.created`, `event.replaced`, `event.updated`, `event.deleted`, `event.impact_updated`, and `headline.created` (when a headline is linked to an event).
## Event Categorization

Incoming events are normalized into canonical buckets (earnings, fda_approval, mna, regulatory, product_launch, guidance, etc.).
- `EVENT_CATEGORY_OVERRIDES`: Optional JSON map `{ "custom_category": ["keyword1", "keyword2"] }` to extend keyword triggers.
- Each event stores the original provider category, canonical category, confidence score, and matched keywords under `metadata.classification`.
- Query `/events/categories` to inspect the current taxonomy.

## Event Clustering

The clustering engine groups related events across companies, sectors, and supply chains using configurable rules:

### Clustering Types
- **company_same_symbol**: Events from the same company within 24 hours
- **sector_earnings**: Earnings events from the same sector within 1 week  
- **regulatory_sector**: Regulatory/FDA events affecting the same sector within 72 hours
- **mna_wave**: M&A events in the same sector within 30 days
- **supply_chain**: Events affecting supply chain partners within 48 hours

### Configuration
- `EVENT_CLUSTERING_RULES`: Optional JSON array of custom clustering rules
- `EVENT_SECTOR_MAPPING`: JSON map of symbol to sector (e.g., `{"AAPL":"technology","JPM":"financials"}`)
- `EVENT_SUPPLY_CHAIN_RELATIONSHIPS`: JSON map of symbol to related symbols (e.g., `{"AAPL":["TSM","QCOM"]}`)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /events/clusters` - List clusters with optional time range and type filtering
- `GET /events/clusters/{cluster_id}` - Get specific cluster details
- `GET /events/clusters/symbol/{symbol}` - Get clusters involving a specific symbol
- `POST /events/clusters/analyze` - Generate clustering analysis with summary statistics

Each cluster includes cluster type, primary symbol, related symbols, event IDs, confidence score, and rich metadata about time spans, sectors, and categories.

- **Failure Tracking**: Monitors consecutive failures per subscription
- **Status Management**: Automatically pauses subscriptions after max failures
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable request timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time subscription health and delivery statistics

### Strategy Service Integration

The system is designed for seamless integration with trading strategy services:

```python
# Example strategy service integration
import httpx

async def subscribe_to_high_impact_events():
    subscription = {
        "service_name": "momentum-strategy",
        "webhook_url": "https://strategy-service.com/webhooks/events",
        "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"],
        "categories": ["earnings", "guidance"],
        "min_impact_score": 8,
        "event_types": ["event.created", "event.impact_changed"]
    }
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "http://event-service:8006/subscriptions",
            json=subscription
        )
        return response.json()

# Webhook handler in strategy service
@app.post("/webhooks/events")
async def handle_event_notification(request: Request):
    event_data = await request.json()
    
    if event_data["event_type"] == "event.created":
        # React to new high-impact event
        await prepare_trading_strategy(event_data["data"])
    
    return {"status": "processed"}
```

See `examples/strategy_service_client.py` for a complete working example of a strategy service that subscribes to events and reacts with trading logic.

### Configuration

Environment variables for subscription system:

- **Webhook Delivery**: Built into the subscription manager
- **Concurrency**: Async delivery to all active subscriptions
- **Memory Management**: In-memory subscription storage (consider Redis for production clustering)

The subscription system provides the foundation for building sophisticated event-driven trading strategies that can react in real-time to market-moving events.

## Real-time Event Enrichment

The service includes a comprehensive event enrichment system that automatically adds market context to events, enabling more sophisticated impact scoring and strategy targeting. Events are enriched with market cap, sector, volatility, and other financial metrics from multiple data sources.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Source Data**: Integrates Finnhub API, Yahoo Finance, and configurable sector mappings
- **Market Context**: Market cap, sector, industry, volatility, beta, average volume, and current price
- **Impact Modifiers**: Automatic impact score adjustments based on company characteristics
- **Performance Optimized**: 30-minute caching, batch processing, and async operations
- **Automatic Integration**: Events are enriched during ingestion and API creation
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continues processing even if enrichment fails

### Market Context Data

Each enriched event includes comprehensive market context:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "enrichment": {
      "market_context": {
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "market_cap": 3000000000000,
        "market_cap_tier": "mega_cap",
        "sector": "technology",
        "industry": "consumer_electronics",
        "avg_volume": 89500000,
        "beta": 1.28,
        "volatility_30d": 24.5,
        "volatility_level": "moderate",
        "price": 185.42,
        "shares_outstanding": 16100000000,

      "enrichment_version": "1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Market Cap Classification

Events are classified by market capitalization tier with automatic impact modifiers:

- **Mega-cap** (>$200B): +2.0 impact modifier
- **Large-cap** ($10B-$200B): +1.5 impact modifier  
- **Mid-cap** ($2B-$10B): +1.0 impact modifier
- **Small-cap** ($300M-$2B): +0.5 impact modifier
- **Micro-cap** (<$300M): -0.5 impact modifier

### Volatility Analysis

30-day volatility is calculated and classified into risk levels:

- **Very Low** (<10%): -0.5 impact modifier
- **Low** (10-20%): 0.0 impact modifier
- **Moderate** (20-35%): +0.5 impact modifier
- **High** (35-50%): +1.0 impact modifier
- **Very High** (>50%): +1.5 impact modifier

### Impact on Strategy Services

Enriched events enable more sophisticated trading strategies:

```python
# Strategy service can now react based on market context
@app.post("/webhooks/events")
async def handle_enriched_event(request: Request):
    event_data = await request.json()
    
    # Access enrichment data
    enrichment = event_data["data"]["metadata"]["enrichment"]
    market_context = enrichment["market_context"]
    impact_modifiers = enrichment["impact_modifiers"]
    
    # Strategy decisions based on enrichment
    if market_context["market_cap_tier"] == "mega_cap":
        # High liquidity, can use larger position sizes
        position_size = calculate_position_size(base_size * 1.5)
    
    if market_context["volatility_level"] == "very_high":
        # High volatility, reduce position size and use tighter stops
        position_size *= 0.7
        stop_loss_pct = 0.02  # 2% stop instead of 3%
    
    # Adjust expected impact based on modifiers
    total_modifier = sum(impact_modifiers.values())
    adjusted_impact = min(10, max(1, base_impact + total_modifier))
    
    if adjusted_impact >= 9:
        # Very high impact event, prepare for significant movement
        await prepare_high_impact_strategy(event_data)
```

See `examples/enrichment_demo.py` for a complete demonstration of the enrichment capabilities.

### Data Sources

The enrichment service uses multiple data sources for comprehensive coverage:

1. **Finnhub API**: Market cap, sector, beta, financials, real-time quotes
2. **Yahoo Finance**: Historical prices, volume data, volatility calculations
3. **Sector Mapping**: Configurable symbol-to-sector mapping for classification
4. **Caching Layer**: In-memory caching to optimize API usage and performance

The enrichment system significantly enhances the trading platform's ability to assess event impact and make intelligent strategy decisions based on comprehensive market context.

## Event Lifecycle Tracking

The service includes a sophisticated lifecycle tracking system that monitors events from scheduled state through occurrence to comprehensive impact analysis. This enables automated performance measurement, prediction accuracy tracking, and strategy optimization.

### Key Features
- **Automated Progression**: Events automatically transition through 4 lifecycle stages
- **Status Monitoring**: Tracks 5 event statuses with complete history logging
- **Impact Analysis**: Comprehensive post-event analysis with market data integration
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Compares predicted vs actual impact with scoring
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors prediction model performance over time
- **Manual Control**: API endpoints for manual status updates and analysis triggers

### Lifecycle Stages

Events progress through four distinct stages:

1. **Pre-Event** (4+ hours before): Preparation and positioning phase
2. **Event Window** (4 hours before to 1 hour after): Active monitoring phase
3. **Post-Event** (1-72 hours after): Impact measurement phase
4. **Analysis Complete** (72+ hours after): Final analysis and archival

### Event Statuses

Events can have the following statuses with automatic and manual transitions:

- **Scheduled**: Event is planned and upcoming
- **Occurred**: Event has taken place
- **Cancelled**: Event was cancelled before occurring
- **Postponed**: Event was delayed to a new date
- **Impact Analyzed**: Complete analysis has been performed

### Impact Analysis

When events transition to "occurred" status, the system automatically schedules comprehensive impact analysis:

```json
{
  "impact_metrics": {
    "event_id": "event-123",
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "predicted_impact": 8.0,
    "actual_impact": 7.2,

  "scheduled_at": "2025-02-15T16:30:00Z"
}

# System automatically detects new symbol and triggers backfill
# Background process fetches 1-year historical data
# Events are categorized, scored, and enriched automatically
```

#### Manual Backfill Request
```python
# Request specific historical data
POST /backfill/symbols/TSLA?start_date=2023-01-01&categories=earnings,split&priority=1

# Monitor progress
GET /backfill/status/TSLA

# Check results
GET /events?symbol=TSLA&limit=100
```

The historical backfill system ensures that new symbols have complete historical context from the moment they're added to the platform, enabling sophisticated analysis and strategy development without manual data management.

## Data Retention and Archival Policies

The Event Data Service includes a comprehensive data retention and archival system to manage storage costs, ensure compliance, and optimize performance over time.

### Retention Policy Overview

The system implements a 5-tier data lifecycle management strategy:

1. **Active Data (0-30 days)** - Recent events and headlines stored in primary database
2. **Warm Data (30-180 days)** - Less frequently accessed data, optimized for query performance  
3. **Cold Data (180 days-2 years)** - Archived to compressed formats, available on demand
4. **Compliance Data (2-7 years)** - Long-term archive for regulatory requirements
5. **Deletion (7+ years)** - Permanent removal of expired data

### Default Retention Rules

#### Events
- **Active Events** (30 days): Recent scheduled/occurred events in primary storage
- **Warm Events** (180 days): Completed events with fast query access
- **Cold Events** (2 years): Compressed JSON/Parquet archives
- **Compliance Events** (7 years): Parquet format for regulatory compliance
- **Deletion** (7+ years): Permanent removal of very old events

#### Headlines
- **Active Headlines** (60 days): Recent headlines linked to events
- **Archive Headlines** (1 year): Compressed JSON archives  
- **Deletion** (1+ years): Permanent removal of old headlines

### Configuration

Configure retention policies via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable retention service
RETENTION_ENABLED=true

# Cleanup frequency (hours)
RETENTION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=24

# Archive storage location

## Redis Caching Layer

The Event Data Service includes a high-performance Redis caching layer that significantly reduces database load and improves response times for frequently accessed data.

### Cache Architecture

The caching system implements a multi-tier strategy with intelligent cache invalidation:

- **Event Cache**: Individual events cached by ID (1 hour TTL)
- **List Cache**: Event list queries cached with parameters (5 minutes TTL)  
- **Search Cache**: Complex search results cached (10 minutes TTL)
- **Aggregation Cache**: Statistical aggregations cached (15 minutes TTL)
- **Enrichment Cache**: Market context data cached (2 hours TTL)

### Performance Benefits

**Typical Performance Improvements:**
- Single event retrieval: 60-80% faster on cache hit
- Event list queries: 70-90% faster on cache hit
- Complex searches: 80-95% faster on cache hit
- Reduced database load: 40-60% fewer DB queries

### Configuration

Configure the Redis cache via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable Redis caching
EVENT_CACHE_ENABLED=true

# Redis connection (inherits from main Redis config)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
EVENT_CACHE_DB=1
EVENT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=3600
EVENT_CACHE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
EVENT_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX=event_cache

# Performance tuning
EVENT_CACHE_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD=1024
EVENT_CACHE_BATCH_SIZE=100
EVENT_CACHE_TIMEOUT=5.0
```

### Cache Management API

#### Get Cache Statistics
```bash
GET /cache/stats
```
Returns comprehensive cache performance metrics and Redis statistics.

#### Cache Health Check
```bash
GET /cache/health
```
Returns cache service health status and connection information.

#### Invalidate Specific Event
```bash
POST /cache/invalidate/event/{event_id}?symbol=AAPL
```
Invalidates all cache entries related to a specific event.

#### Invalidate Symbol Data
```bash
POST /cache/invalidate/symbol/{symbol}
```
Invalidates all cache entries for a specific symbol.

#### Pattern-Based Invalidation
```bash
POST /cache/invalidate/pattern?pattern=event_list:*
```
Invalidates cache entries matching a specific pattern.

#### Clear All Cache
```bash
DELETE /cache/clear
```
Clears all cache data (use with caution in production).

### Automatic Cache Invalidation

The cache system automatically invalidates relevant entries when data changes:

**Event Operations:**
- Creating events: Invalidates list and search caches
- Updating events: Invalidates event, list, and symbol-related caches  
- Deleting events: Invalidates all related cache entries

**Smart Invalidation:**
- Symbol-based invalidation for related data
- Pattern-based cleanup for list queries
- Hierarchical invalidation for nested relationships

### Cache Key Structure

Cache keys follow a structured namespace pattern:

```
event_cache:event:{event_id}
event_cache:event_list:list:symbol=AAPL&category=earnings
event_cache:search:{hash}:symbol=AAPL&limit=10
event_cache:agg:stats:{hash}:symbol=AAPL
```

### Data Compression

**Automatic Compression:**
- Data larger than 1KB is automatically compressed with gzip
- Base64 encoding for Redis storage compatibility
- Transparent decompression on retrieval
- Achieves 60-80% size reduction for typical event data

### Monitoring and Analytics

**Built-in Metrics:**
- Hit/miss ratios per cache type
- Response time improvements
- Memory usage and key counts
- Redis server statistics

**Health Integration:**
Cache status is included in the main `/health` endpoint:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "status": "connected", 
    "total_keys": 1547,
    "hit_rate": 0.73,
    "memory_usage_mb": 12.4
  }
}
```

### Cache Strategies

**Time-Based (TTL):** Default strategy with automatic expiration
**LRU Support:** Least-recently-used eviction for memory management
**Write-Through:** Updates both cache and database simultaneously
**Smart Prefetching:** Proactive caching of related data

### Production Considerations

**Memory Management:**
- Monitor Redis memory usage with `INFO memory`
- Configure max memory and eviction policies
- Use Redis clustering for high-traffic deployments

**Performance Tuning:**
- Adjust TTL values based on data change frequency
- Configure compression threshold for optimal performance
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust strategies accordingly

**Security:**
- Use Redis AUTH for production deployments
- Configure network security and firewall rules
- Regular backup and monitoring of Redis instances
