## SLO Framework

### Metrics Definitions

- **Freshness**: Time between data event occurrence and availability in our systems
- **Availability**: Percentage of time the feed is operational and delivering data
- **Completeness**: Percentage of expected data points received
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of data points matching authoritative source
- **Latency**: End-to-end delivery time from source to consumer

### SLO Tiers

- **Tier 1 (Critical)**: Real-time trading feeds - strictest requirements
- **Tier 2 (Important)**: Market data and analytics - standard requirements
- **Tier 3 (Best Effort)**: Historical data and batch feeds - relaxed requirements

## Chaos Engineering & Resilience Testing

### Monthly Outage Drills

**Objective**: Validate system resilience and recovery procedures
**Target**: MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) < 30 minutes
**Pass Rate**: â‰¥ 95% of drills recover within MTTR

### Drill Schedule

| Feed Type | Drill Frequency | Duration | Recovery Target |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| Market Data | Monthly | 5-10 minutes | < 2 minutes |
| Options Data | Quarterly | 10-15 minutes | < 5 minutes |
| Macro Indicators | Quarterly | 15-30 minutes | < 10 minutes |
| News Headlines | Monthly | 5-10 minutes | < 3 minutes |

### Drill Procedures

1. **Pre-Drill**:
   - Announce drill 24 hours in advance (non-market hours only)
   - Document baseline metrics
   - Verify failover systems ready

2. **During Drill**:
   - Simulate feed outage via `jobs/chaos/feed_outage_drill.py`
   - Monitor failover activation
   - Track recovery metrics
   - Log all alerts and actions

3. **Post-Drill**:
   - Measure MTTR
   - Document failures and improvements
   - Update runbooks
   - Generate drill report

### Chaos Test Coverage

- **Primary feed failure**: Automatic failover to backup provider
- **Network partition**: Data caching and replay mechanisms
- **Slow/degraded feed**: Circuit breaker and quality degradation alerts
- **Data corruption**: Validation and anomaly detection
- **Complete provider outage**: Multi-provider redundancy

## Appendix

### A. Calculation Methods

**Availability**:
```
Availability = (Total uptime / Total time) Ã— 100%
Measured during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
```

**Freshness**:
```
Freshness = Event timestamp - Ingestion timestamp
Percentile calculated over 1-minute rolling window
```

**Completeness**:
```
Completeness = (Received messages / Expected messages) Ã— 100%
Expected calculated from historical baseline Â± 3Ïƒ
```
